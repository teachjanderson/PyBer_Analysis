# Pyber Ride-Sharing Data #

## Overview and Purpose ##

PyBer requested an analysis of ride-sharing data to determine the weekly fares for rural, suburban, and urban cities. By identifying total rides, drivers, fares and their averages, the analysis provides useful insights into differences among the city types. The purpose of identifying these differences will provide insights and recommedations for Pyber decision making in the areas of weekly fare pricing, access to ride sharing services, and affordability in different city types. This information is represented in the results section for dates ranging between January and April of 2019.

## Closing Summary ##
  
Four take aways are worth noting in the final, adjusted analysis:
  - First, this set of data will now show NaN for all 9th grade scores at Thomas High School. 
  - Second, the overall passing rate for Thomas High School changed dramtically once the 9th grade scores were removed, but evaluating them based on the 10th-12th grade students returned the schools numbers similar to before the change. Thomas High School is now ranked similar or better than many schools in the district. 
  - Third, while Thomas High did see changes in performance, many of its metrics did not significantly change and its overall scores in math and reading (10th-12th grades) were well above the 70% threshold. 
  - Finally, removal of the 9th grade scores at Thomas High School did not alter the overall district data to a substantial amount (less than 1% in the key indicators). This should provide confidence for the district in the overall fidelity of its data.
