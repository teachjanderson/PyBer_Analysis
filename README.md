# Pyber Ride-Sharing Data #

## Overview and Purpose ##

PyBer requested an analysis of ride-sharing data to determine the weekly fares for rural, suburban, and urban cities. By identifying total rides, drivers, fares and their averages, the analysis provides useful insights into differences among the city types. The purpose of identifying these differences will provide insights and recommedations for Pyber decision making in the areas of weekly fare pricing, access to ride sharing services, and affordability in different city types. This information is represented in the results section for dates ranging between January and April of 2019. 

# Results #

***Overall Trends***

The PyBer analysis revealed several differences between the three city types as seen in the table below. 
 - Rural: There were 125 total rides in the dataset with a total of 78 drivers. The total fares are around ~$4,000 with an average cost of $34.62 per ride and an average fare of $55.49 per driver. 
 - Suburban: There were 625 total rides in the dataset with a total of 490 drivers. The total fares are almost ~$20,000 with an average cost of $30.97 per ride and an average fare of $39.50 per driver. 
 - Urban: There were 1,625 total rides in the dataset with a total of 2,405 drivers. The total fares are almost ~$40,000 with an average cost of $24.53 per ride and an average fare of $16.57 per driver.

***Weekly Fares***
 
The multiple-line chart below shows weekly fares by city type for January to April in 2019. Of the three city types, the rural city type remains the most constant with the suburban and urban types showing more variability. However, all three types show a fairly consistent revenue amount with the urban type generating the most revenue followed by the suburban type. Within the date range, the urban type generated 7 to 9 times the amount of revenue of the suburban type and nearly 2 times the amount of the suburban. This is expected as the urban type is providing about 13 times the number of rides as the rural type and almost 3 times that of the suburban type. The fare difference of the types is considerable. While the rural area generates nearly 4 times the amount per ride as the urban type, the urban areas generate nearly 10 times as much revenue overall. This is expected as urban areas consist of more densely populated areas and greater demands for transportation than suburban and rural areas.

***Conclusions***
 - Urban cities generate the most revenue for PyBer
 - Urban cities generate less per ride and drivers earn less per ride
 - Suburban areas provide a middle-ground revenue source for PyBer that is half the Urban area but still a substantial amount
 - Rural areas genereate the least revenue for PyBer but earn the most per ride
  
      
## Recommendations ##
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)

  
  
Based on the data analyis, three business recommendations are described below:
  - The data displays variances in ride revenue. Extending this study to a greater range could demonstrate more trends such as when to increase availability of rides in different areas. This would benefit both PyBer and its drivers. Determining which drivers are able to change location between urban, suburban, and rural areas could likewise increase revenue for PyBer and its drivers. This could create recommendations of increasing rides while keeping the number of overall drivers constant. 
  - While rural areas bring in the least revenue, further analysis is recommended to determine the demand vs supply in rural areas. If demand is greater, increasing suppply, as fare per ride is greatest in the rural city type, could increase overall revenue for this city type. 
  Based on urban data, since it generates the greatest revenue, we can see there are more drivers available than rides demanded. This ratio comes out to about 1.5 drivers supplied for every 1 ride demanded. PyBer could increase the available drivers in the suburban and rural areas to see find a ratio that generates the most profit. Given that suburban and rural areas likely have less demand, as personal vehicles are in greater abundance, it is recommended increasing the number of drivers to at least equal the number of rides to determine if this will increase overall revenue.
